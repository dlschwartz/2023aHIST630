#### Choosing a Text to Encode
Each student will need to identify a text or collection of texts to encode using 
the TEI. I would recommend that you choose something you are interested in 
studying and you may want to think of this assignment as an opportunity to 
begin a text encoding project that you could imagine becoming part of a 
research project, conference paper, dissertation chapter, etc. If you are working 
on the Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate this could be the start of something 
that you could develop further for your digital project, for more information see. 
[Certificate Requirements](https://dhcertificate.tamu.edu/graduate-certificate-requirements/){:target="_blank"}
and [Certificate FAQs](https://dhcertificate.tamu.edu/faqs/){:target="_blank"}.
If you are struggling to find something appropriate, please meet with me to discuss possibilities.

While I want you to find something of interest to your work, I do have a couple of 
qualifiers because I want you to gain experience with different kinds of data 
and different approaches to using the TEI. 

- Length
	- Think in terms of 5-8 pages of text. This can be an entire text, a piece of a 
	large text, or several small texts. If you do very simple encoding of a 
	very straightforward text, this might not be very much work. If you have a difficult 
	text and mark things up in extreem detail, 5 pages very well might take you 
	beyond a reasonable amount of work. At the beginning, aim to find a text in 
	this 5-8 page range. If your research aims are better met by a shorter or longer 
	text, I am happy to discuss a different scale for your encoding project.
- Content
	- Your encoding project needs to include both the encoding of a text and also 
	some standoff markup. Find a text that includes at least two of the following: 
	persons, places, or content that would benefit from a taxonomy describing that 
	content. Such content could include physical objects, concepts, etc.

#### To Submit for Evaluation
- Text Encoding 
	- You will produce a TEI-encoded XML file for each text or piece of text you 
	encode. For some students, this will be one XML file. Other students will produce 
	several XML files, one for each smaller text they encode. 
- Standoff Markup
	- You will also need to mark up information about the content of your text as discussed 
	above. If you have a taxonomy as one of your two additional data types, that 
	will appear in the header of your main TEI file. If you have one or both of 
	the others, you will encode that in a separate TEI file. We will discuss standoff 
	markup in more detail in class.
- Valid TEI
	- Your TEI files must validate against a customized schema you have created. See, 
	the [ODD Customization Assignment](../odd/).

#### Due Date
- You should work locally on your own machine but commit and push (preferably to a draft 
repository) in GitHub on a regular basis. You will need to share a link to these files on GitHub by the 
due date for final work [11 December](../schedule/#11-december).
