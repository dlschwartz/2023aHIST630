## Course Description
Introduction to formal methods of analysis in historical research
using computers; and applying quantitative methods to research problems.  

_____
## Course Goals
Digital History, and Digital Humanities more broadly, encompasses a tremendously 
wide set of research methodologies and scholarly practices. No one course could 
possibly do justice to all of them. 

This course takes a skills-oriented approach to Digital History and indeed focuses 
on one method for doing Digital History: text encoding. Students will learn how to 
use the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard of Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
to encode textual material. They will also learn a range or coding skills important 
for producing, editing, documenting, presenting, and preserving a digital project.

_____
## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course you will  
- Understand XML and text encoding as digital research methodologies for historical research.
- Apply a range of XML programming technologies to historical research: TEI, XQuery, XPath, RegEx, ODD, Schematron, HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
- Use GitHub to work collaboratively and share historical research.
- Develop a digital research project using XML programming technologies.
- Write digital project documentation using a combination of traditional prose and technical methodologies.

## Prerequisites
Graduate classification or approval of instructor.

_____
## Required Textbook:
Anderson and Wicentowski, XQuery for Humanists, TAMU Press, 2020.

_____
## Required Hardware:
Students will all need to have access to a laptop to which they have permission to add software. 
You should bring that laptop to all class sessions. All required software is either open source or
otherwise free of charge. We will learn how to download this software as part of learning how to use it.

_____
## Online Resources
In addition to the required textbook, additional readings will be available through 
course reserves or on Canvas. This course will also make use of The Programming Historian 
website and the universityâ€™s subscription to inLearning as a way to learn and practice 
digital skills in advance of in-class labs where we will take these skills further.

_____
## Expectations
You will note in the class schedule that every class meeting has a heading for
_Ludi_. This is a Latin word we'll translate here as "play things." I have
chosen this term because I want us all to think of class time as an opportunity
to experiment, collaborate, offer feedback, and troubleshoot difficulties. In short,
you should come to class expecting to _play around_ with the course material, topics,
and skills you will begin learning outside of class. This approach means there is a high
likelihood that sometimes things won't work, or at least that they won't work as intended.
We should all expect this kind of "failure." But failure can be productive. Let's
all come to class ready to play, have fun even, and learn as we go.

## Acknowledgements
I read many course syllabi in designing this syllabus but drew most heavily on one by Michelle 
M. Taylor and David A. Michelson. They taught "Special Topics in the Digital Humanities:
Encoding Culture," at Vanderbilt University in spring 2019.
