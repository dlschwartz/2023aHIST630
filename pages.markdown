On the schedule for [19 September](../schedule/#19-september), you will find two links for online 
tutorials. Each offers a slightly different approach to creating a website that is freely 
hosted on GitHub. For this assignment, I would like you to use these tutorials to create a website 
on GitHub pages. You may make a website on any topic you like, using any Jekyll theme you would like
(provided it is [supported by GitHub](https://pages.github.com/themes/){:target="_blank"}). This syllabus has been created using the skills 
discussed in these tutorials. Now that you are proficient in using GitHub, you should be able to 
find the syllabus on GitHub and see what's there. 

As I said, your website can be on any topic you would like. If inspiration doesn't strike, let me suggest
a digital CV. Here's [a link to my CV](https://dlschwartz.github.io/cv/){:target="_blank"} in case you might find it helpful to
have an example. This is easily built and easily maintained. If you do not have a personal website with
this kind of information, you may want to maintain such a CV beyond this class.

Whatever you choose to put up, I would like your site to contain the following:
* Several pages built using Markdown
* One or more links to external websites that open in a separate tab
* One or more links to anchors (i.e., section headings designated in markdown with one or more "#" characters)
* One or more photos

You will work through the tutorials and draft your project over the week of 19 September when class does not 
meet because I will be traveling. As part of the _Ludi_ for class on 26 September we will look at your drafts 
and trouble-shoot problems together. 

This assignment is due on ***Monday, 30 September***. Please email me a link to 
the website and to the GitHub repo from which the website is generated.
