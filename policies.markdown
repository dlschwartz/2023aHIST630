### Intellectual Property Rights
Most of the assignments for this course will be posted on GitHub. For this and
other publically available research output you should include an intellectual property
declaration, license information, or a statement rejecting such rights.

_____
### Attendance
You will need to attend this class regularly. The structure of this course is
essentially flipped. You will read outside of class and you will complete
online tutorials outside of class. Class time will be spent in discussion
and working on building skills in a collaborative setting. You will get answers
to questions and solve problems in class. You will consolidate your learning
in class. You will learn from your peers in class. You will share what you
have learned with your peers in class.

Please make every reasonable effort to communicate with the professor _**in
advance**_ of an absence whether excused or unexcused.

Each unexcused absence will result in a 2% reduction (out of the 15% possible)
to the Class Participation portion of the grade.

### ADA Policy Statement
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute
that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.
Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities
be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation,
please contact Disability Services, currently located in the Disability Services
building at the Student Services at White Creek complex on west campus or call
979-845-1637. For additional information visit <http://disability.tamu.edu/>{:target="_blank"}.

### Academic Integrity
"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal,
or tolerate those who do." Students are expected to be aware of the Aggie Honor
Council Rules and Procedures, see <http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/>{:target="_blank"}.

_____
### Diversity and Respect
The study of cultural and human diversity is a key
component of the study of history. Please respect the different experiences,
beliefs, and values expressed by your fellow students and instructor, and refrain
from derogatory comments about other individuals, cultures, groups, or viewpoints.
The Department of History supports Texas A&M University’s commitment to diversity
and welcomes individuals of all ages, backgrounds, citizenships, (dis)abilities,
education, ethnicities, family statuses, genders, gender identities, geographical
locations, languages, military experience, political views, races, religions, sexual
orientations, socioeconomic statuses, and work experiences.

### Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality
Texas A&M University and the College of Liberal Arts are committed to fostering
a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies
and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment.
Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to
student record policies and laws, University employees — including instructors
— cannot maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility
to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our community.
As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&M System Regulation 08.01.01) the
following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even
if you do not want the disclosed information to be shared:

Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when
they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting campus.

These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk
with you about the incident that you have shared. In many cases, it will be your
decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual. If you would
like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are
encouraged to make an appointment with the Student Counseling Service
(<https://scs.tamu.edu/>{:target="_blank"}).


Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them to be
concerned at <http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu>{:target="_blank"}.
