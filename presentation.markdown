Each student will have a 10-minute slot on the last day of class to present their digital edition to the class.
Think of these presentations like you would a short conference paper. You should prepare to present within the alloted time 
and cover the following topics:
* Research content, including the textual material encoded and the research questions animating
the encoding of the chosen textual material 
* An environmental scan of similar projects and how this project relates to those projects 
* Digital methodologies, including technical decisions made in designing the project
