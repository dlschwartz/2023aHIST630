This course is heavily focused on text encoding and project documentation. There is, of course, much 
more to digital methods for historical research. As a way to address some of the broader methodologies available 
to digital historians, I would like you each to make a 10-minute presentation on a topic not otherwise covered in 
the class. I would like you to choose your topic from among those discussed at the website 
[The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/){:target="_blank"}. Please complete a lesson of your choosing
and prepare a 10-minute presentation on that topic for class on [21 November](../schedule/#21-november).
