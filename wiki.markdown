title: Documentation Wiki Assignment

While the ODD customization and resulting RelaxNG schema 
provides a technical documentation for your project, it is not 
particularly easy for human beings to read. You will use the 
wiki in GitHub to produce a more human-readable version of the 
your TEI customization. 

Feel free to take one (or more) of several approaches 
to this prose documentation. You may want to think of this as an 
opportunity to offer readers a "how to" in case they wanted to 
produce something similar. Alternatively you may 
use the wiki to discuss your experience of using the TEI to 
encode the particular text or texts you have chosen for your project. 
I'm sure other options exist as well. If you have 
questions, please discuss them with me. 

You can find an example of what I have in mind in a documentation wiki 
produced by colleagues working on the Syriaca.org Gazetteer: 
[TEI Encoding Manual for The Syriac Gazetteer](https://github.com/srophe/srophe-app-data/wiki/TEI-Encoding-Manual-for-The-Syriac-Gazetteer){:target="_blank"}

### To Submit for Evaluation
Regardless of the approach you take, your wiki should include the 
following:
- Well-designed markdown encoding of your documentation.
- An 'index' at the top so that users can jump down to topics
they would like to investigate.
- Discussion of specific elements and attributes as used in your 
encoding.
- Snippets of the important pieces of code you discuss.

#### Due Date
- The wiki will exist entirely in GitHub. You will need to share a 
link to your wiki by the due date for final work 
[11 December](../schedule/#11-december).
